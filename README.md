# Pimax Foveated Rendering Loader for Easy Anti-Cheat

## What does it do?

This utility lets you use the Pimax Foveated Rendering feature with games protected with Easy Anti-Cheat.

## Installing

**PLEASE READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW CAREFULLY.**

1) Install [Pimax Play](https://pimax.com/pimax-pc) from the Pimax website and set it up for Eye Tracking and Foveated Rendering as usual.

2) Download the Pimax Magic Loader from the [Releases](https://github.com/mbucchia/PimaxMagic-Loader/releases) page.

3) Locate the folder where SteamVR is installed. It typically is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SteamVR`. Go to the `bin` folder under the SteamVR folder. You should see files named `vrclient.dll` and `vrclient_x64.dll` (**if not, then you are in the wrong folder**).

4) With **SteamVR completely closed**, unzip the Pimax Magic Loader (obtained in step 2) directly into the `bin` folder from step 4).

5) Run `install_pimaxmagic_loader.bat`. The successful output will show:

```
Injecting PimaxMagic-Loader...
        1 file(s) copied.
Press any key to continue . . .
```
